# SwiftBatchRenamer

SwiftBatchRenamer is an easy-to-use Python tool that renames files in a folder with a custom prefix and numbering system. It supports .txt and .png file formats, providing a quick solution for file organization. This tool was created in response to issues caused by extremely long filenames generated by stable-diffusion, which led to file explorer crashes and made it difficult to open folders or rename files one by one via command line.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `setup_env.bat` to set up the virtual environment and install the required dependencies

## Usage

1. Run `run_tool.bat`
2. Select the folder containing the files you want to rename
3. Enter the desired file prefix and starting number for the numbering system
4. Press Submit and the tool will rename your files

## Dependencies

## Motivation

SwiftBatchRenamer was developed to address the challenges faced when working with large numbers of files with long filenames generated by stable-diffusion. These filenames often caused file explorer crashes, making it difficult to open folders or rename files manually. This tool offers an efficient and user-friendly solution for organizing and renaming files in bulk.
